COMPREHENSIVE TEST RESULTS
===========================

PENDULUM RESULTS:
-----------------
1. RRT with Torque=3:
   - Time: 0.103 seconds
   - States: 696
   - File: output/pendulum_rrt_path.txt (overwritten by later tests)

2. KPIECE1 with Torque=3:
   - Time: 30.036 seconds
   - States: 408,846 states in 169,278 cells
   - File: output/pendulum_kpiece_path.txt
   - Much more exhaustive exploration than RRT

3. RRT with Torque=5:
   - Time: 3.900 seconds
   - States: 18,160
   - File: output/pendulum_rrt_path.txt (overwritten by torque=10)

4. RRT with Torque=10:
   - Time: 3.879 seconds
   - States: 11,641
   - File: output/pendulum_rrt_path.txt (final)

OBSERVATIONS - Pendulum:
- Higher torque does NOT always mean faster (torque=3: 0.1s, torque=10: 3.9s)
- This is because higher torque allows larger accelerations, making exploration harder
- KPIECE1 is much slower but more systematic
- All planners successfully found solutions

CAR RESULTS:
------------
5. RRT:
   - Time: 0.165 seconds
   - States: 87
   - File: output/car_rrt_path.txt
   - Very fast solution

6. KPIECE1:
   - Time: 0.036 seconds
   - States: 96 states in 92 cells
   - File: output/car_kpiece_path.txt
   - Even faster than RRT for this problem!

OBSERVATIONS - Car:
- Both planners very fast (<0.2s)
- KPIECE1 slightly more efficient
- Environment is relatively open with few obstacles
- Both respect non-holonomic constraints
